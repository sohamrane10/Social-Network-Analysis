# Social-Network-Analysis
The project leverages the R libraries such as igraph, network, sna, and visNetwork to perform Social Network Analysis (SNA). It visualizes relationships between nodes (vertices) in a network, calculates various centrality measures like degree, closeness, and betweenness, and highlights hubs, authorities, and communities within the network.
